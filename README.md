# Responsivenes with bootstrap

### How bootstrap grid layout works
- bootstrap comes with 12 column grid system, it takes care of responsive work for us.
- if u run index-v1.html u will see following behavior
   - ```col-lg-3``` --> 4 column on large devices
   - ```col-sm-6``` --> two column on small devices, other two will be adjusted automatically in another row
